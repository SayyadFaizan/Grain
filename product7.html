	<p>
		Rye (Secale cereale) is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the tribe Triticeae and is closely related to both wheat (Triticum) and barley (genus Hordeum).Rye grain is used for flour, bread, beer, crispbread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats.Rye is a cereal grain and should not be confused with ryegrass, which is used for lawns, pasture, and as hay for livestock.Rye is one of a number of species that grow wild in the Levant, central and eastern Turkey and in adjacent areas. Evidence uncovered at the Epipalaeolithic site of Tell Abu Hureyra in the Euphrates valley of northern Syria suggests that rye was among the first cereal crops to be systematically cultivated, around 13,000 years ago.However, that claim remains controversial; critics point to inconsistencies in the radiocarbon dates, and identifications based solely on grain, rather than on chaff.Domesticated rye occurs in small quantities at a number of Neolithic sites in Asia Minor (Anatolia, now Turkey), such as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B Can Hasan III near Çatalhöyük,but is otherwise absent from the archaeological record until the Bronze Age of central Europe, c. 1800–1500 BCE.It is possible that rye traveled west from Asia Minor as a minor admixture in wheat (possibly as a result of Vavilovian mimicry), and was only later cultivated in its own right.Archeological evidence of this grain has been found in Roman contexts along the Rhine and the Danube and in Ireland and Britain.Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder was dismissive of a grain that may have been rye, writing that it "is a very poor food and only serves to avert starvation".He said it was mixed with spelt "to mitigate its bitter taste, and even then is most unpleasant to the stomach"
