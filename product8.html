	<h1>SORGHUM</h1>

	<p>
		Sorghum (/ˈsɔːrɡəm/) is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the grass family (Poaceae). Some of these species are grown as cereals for human consumption and some in pastures for animals. One species is grown for grain, while many others are used as fodder plants, either cultivated in warm climates worldwide or naturalized in pasture lands.Sorghum was domesticated from its wild ancestor more than 5,000 years ago in what is today Sudan. The newest evidence comes from an archaeological site near Kassala in eastern Sudan, dating from 3500 to 3000 BC, and is associated with the neolithic Butana Group culture. It was the staple food of the kingdom of Alodia.Agrobacterium transformation can be used on this genus. Che et al., 2018 provides such a transformation system with a good success rate.Seventeen of the 25 species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian- and Pacific- Oceans.Nigeria accounts for 12% of world product and USA accounts for 10%. Other major producing countries are Sudan, Mexico, Ethiopia, India, Argentina, China, and Brazil.The grains are edible and nutritious. It can be eaten raw when young and milky, but has to be boiled when older.One species, S. bicolor, native to Africa with many cultivated forms, is an important crop worldwide, used for food (in the form of grain or sorghum syrup), animal fodder, the production of alcoholic beverages, and biofuels. Sorghum's cultivation has been linked by archeological research back to ancient Sudan around 6,000 to 7,000 BP.All sorghums contain phenolic acids, and most contain flavonoids.Sorghum grains are one of the highest food sources of the flavonoid proanthocyanidin.Total phenol content (in both phenolic acids and flavonoids) is correlated with antioxidant activity.Antioxidant activity is high in sorghums having dark pericarp and pigmented testa.The antioxidant activity of sorghum may explain the reduced incidence of certain cancers in populations consuming sorghum.
